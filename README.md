# COGNIFLOW AI: Intelligent Adaptive Traffic Signal and Vehicle Classification System

This project proposes an AI-powered adaptive traffic management system to address urban congestion by dynamically adjusting signal timings based on real-time vehicle detection and classification using deep learning.

The system consists of two primary components:

1. **Interface Mode (User-facing)**
   - A React-based frontend.
   - A FastAPI backend for processing video input and generating predictions.

2. **Model-only Mode**
   - Standalone scripts for training and evaluating vehicle detection/classification models using YOLOv11 and YOLOv8.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time vehicle detection and classification using YOLO.
- Number plate recognition via YOLOv11.
- Adaptive signal control based on real-time traffic conditions.
- Frontend dashboard for live monitoring and interaction.
- REST API powered by FastAPI for modular backend logic.

## üß† Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, OpenCV, Uvicorn
- **ML Models:** YOLOv11 (number plate detection), YOLOv8 (vehicle classification)
- **Simulation:** SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)
- **Tools:** PyTorch, Roboflow, LabelImg, COCO/Cityscapes datasets
